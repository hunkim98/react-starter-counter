/**
 * React can be seen as HTML + JS + CSS(Optional) in one package
 * Inside the function we write functions that we would like to trigger when needed (e.g. onClick, page load, etc.)
 * The function returns the HTML code that we want to display
 * The HTML code is written in JSX (JavaScript XML) which is a combination of HTML and JavaScript
 *
 * A function is called a component in React
 * You can understand component as a package of HTML, CSS and JS
 * The important thing is that in react, you create components with functions
 * In previous versions of React, you would create components with classes (even Android Studio Java uses classes to create Mobile Views)
 *
 * App.js is the main component(or function) that is called when the app is loaded.
 * App.js can be seen as the main function that calls other (children) functions
